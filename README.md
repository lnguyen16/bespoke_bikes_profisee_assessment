# bespoke_bikes_profisee_assessment

This is my technical assessment project for Profisee for the role of Software Developer. I utilized the tech stack of MERN to develop a demo of a bike sales application. 

Purpose of this project: 
BeSpoked Bikes is looking to create a sales tracking application. BeSpoked is a high-end bicycle shop
and each salesperson gets a commission for each bike they sell. They are introducing a new
quarterly bonus based on sales as an incentive.
They are asking you to design a simple sales tracking application to help track the commission and
determine each salespersonâ€™s quarterly bonus.

Database Architect:
Here is a database architecture I did prior to working on the backend!
